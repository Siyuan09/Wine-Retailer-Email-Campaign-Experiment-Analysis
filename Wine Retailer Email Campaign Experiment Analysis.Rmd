a) Evaluation of the average causal effect: For this section, we first look at the average effect of open, click and purch. Then plot a bar chart to see the results.
```{r}
rm(list = ls())
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(grf)

wine <- read.csv('~/Desktop/Simon/Courses/SpringA_GBA424 Analytics Design & Applications/Assignment/Wine retailer Case/test_data_1904.csv', stringsAsFactors = F, header = TRUE)
summary(wine)

# Depicit average causal effect of variables to get a general idea
wine_table = data.table(wine)
dagg = wine_table[,.(open = mean(open), click=mean(click), purch = mean(purch),seOpen = sd(open)/sqrt(.N), seClick=sd(click)/sqrt(.N), sePurch = sd(purch)/sqrt(.N),.N),by = .(group)]
dagg
dodge = position_dodge(width=1); ##to form constant dimensions
ggplot(aes(x=group,y=purch,ymax=purch+sePurch,ymin=purch-sePurch),data=dagg)+
  geom_bar(position=dodge,stat="identity", fill =c("#803838", "#1E4163"), width=0.5)  +
  geom_errorbar(position=dodge,width=0.5)
  labs(x="Group",y="Purchases") 
```

What's more, we also want to look at the effect of applying email. However, there would be some contamination/omit variables which makes the prediction not precise, therefore, we add control variables as baseline. After this step, we realized that last purchase should be removed becasue of the colinearity. Furthermore, aware of the recency would have impact on the prediction, as a result, we finalized a time period for the recent purchase.
```{r}
# Get the average causal effect without control variables
summary(lm(purch~group,data=wine))

wine$email = (wine$group != "ctrl")

summary(lm(purch~email,data=wine))

# Add control variables since there may be some contamination
summary(lm(purch~email+chard+sav_blanc+syrah+cab+past_purch+last_purch+visits,data=wine))

# Rule out the 'past purchase' because of colinearity
summary(lm(purch~group+chard+sav_blanc+syrah+cab+last_purch+visits,data=wine))

# Plot the histogram for most recent purchase
hist(wine$last_purch, 
     xlab="Days Since Last Purchase", ylab="Customers", 
     main="Histogram of Days Since Last Purchase")

# Find the time period for recency
wine$recentPurch = (wine$last_purch < 45)
```

b)Slice and dice analysis: For this section, we illustrated the potential for targeting on response for this email with various causal effects which make differences. And plot each slice and dice analysis results.
```{r}
# Slice and dice analysis for test groups
# Rencency

dt = data.table(wine)
dagg = dt[,.(open = mean(open), click=mean(click), purch = mean(purch),seOpen = sd(open)/sqrt(.N), seClick=sd(click)/sqrt(.N), sePurch = sd(purch)/sqrt(.N),.N),by = .(group,recentPurch)]

dodge = position_dodge(width=1); 
ggplot(aes(fill=group,y=purch,x=recentPurch,ymax=purch+sePurch,ymin=purch-sePurch),data=dagg)+
  geom_bar(position=dodge,stat="identity") + scale_fill_manual(values=c("#803838", "#1E4163")) +
  geom_errorbar(position=dodge)
  labs(x="Group",y="Purchases")
```

```{r}
# Slice and dice analysis for test groups
# buySyrah but may not useful since based on the coefficients, Syrah is not significant.

wine$buySyrah <- (wine$syrah > 0) # >0 to show whether bought this product
dt = data.table(wine)
dagg = dt[,.(open = mean(open), click=mean(click), purch = mean(purch),seOpen = sd(open)/sqrt(.N), seClick=sd(click)/sqrt(.N), sePurch = sd(purch)/sqrt(.N),.N),by = .(group,buySyrah)] 
dagg

#Plot the results
dodge = position_dodge(width=1); 
ggplot(aes(fill=group,y=purch,x=buySyrah,ymax=purch+sePurch,ymin=purch-sePurch),data=dagg)+
  geom_bar(position=dodge,stat="identity") + scale_fill_manual(values=c("#803838", "#1E4163")) +
  geom_errorbar(position=dodge)
  labs(x="Group",y="Purchases")
```

```{r}
# Slice and dice analysis for test groups
# buyChard

wine$buyChard <- (wine$chard > 0) # >0 to show whether bought this product
dt = data.table(wine)
dagg = dt[,.(open = mean(open), click=mean(click), purch = mean(purch),seOpen = sd(open)/sqrt(.N), seClick=sd(click)/sqrt(.N), sePurch = sd(purch)/sqrt(.N),.N),by = .(group,buyChard)] 
dagg

#Plot the results
dodge = position_dodge(width=1); 
ggplot(aes(fill=group,y=purch,x=buyChard,ymax=purch+sePurch,ymin=purch-sePurch),data=dagg)+
  geom_bar(position=dodge,stat="identity") + scale_fill_manual(values=c("#803838", "#1E4163")) +
  geom_errorbar(position=dodge)
  labs(x="Group",y="Purchases")
```

```{r}
# Slice and dice analysis for test groups
# buySav_blanc

wine$buySav_blanc  <- (wine$sav_blanc > 0) 
dt = data.table(wine)
dagg = dt[,.(open = mean(open), click=mean(click), purch = mean(purch),seOpen = sd(open)/sqrt(.N), seClick=sd(click)/sqrt(.N), sePurch = sd(purch)/sqrt(.N),.N),by = .(group,buySav_blanc )] 
dagg

#Plot the results
dodge = position_dodge(width=1); 
ggplot(aes(fill=group,y=purch,x=buySav_blanc ,ymax=purch+sePurch,ymin=purch-sePurch),data=dagg)+
  geom_bar(position=dodge,stat="identity") +  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#803838", "#1E4163")) +
  geom_errorbar(position=dodge)
  labs(x="Group",y="Purchases")  
```

```{r}
# Slice and dice analysis for test groups
# buyCab

wine$buyCab  <- (wine$cab > 0) # or > 0 
dt = data.table(wine)
dagg = dt[,.(open = mean(open), click=mean(click), purch = mean(purch),seOpen = sd(open)/sqrt(.N), seClick=sd(click)/sqrt(.N), sePurch = sd(purch)/sqrt(.N),.N),by = .(group,buyCab )] 
dagg

#Plot the results
dodge = position_dodge(width=1); 
ggplot(aes(fill=group,y=purch,x=buyCab ,ymax=purch+sePurch,ymin=purch-sePurch),data=dagg)+
  geom_bar(position=dodge,stat="identity") + scale_fill_manual(values=c("#803838", "#1E4163")) +
  geom_errorbar(position=dodge)
  labs(x="Group",y="Purchases")  

```  

```{r}
# Try different products' causal effect on purchasing

summary(lm(purch~email*recentPurch,data=wine)) 

summary(lm(purch~recentPurch + email:recentPurch,data=wine))

summary(lm(purch~buyCab + buyCab:group,data=wine))

summary(lm(purch~buySav_blanc + buySav_blanc:group,data=wine))

summary(lm(purch~buyChard + buyChard:group,data=wine))

```

c)“Individual-level” conditional causal effect: For this section, we use causal forest to further validate our results of previous model. Causal forest was applied in this part. The blackbox model of causal forest would give us results and importance of different variables automatically with machine learning. And we also predict the training data based on the model, as well as estimate the average treatment effect for the target sample.
```{r}
#Causal forest

set.seed(0) # To produce identical results
treat <- wine$email
response <- wine$purch
baseline <- wine[, c("last_purch", "visits", "chard", "sav_blanc", "syrah", "cab")]
tmp=proc.time()[3]
cf <- causal_forest(baseline, response, treat)
tmp = proc.time()[3]-tmp
print(cf)


ii#Find the average treatment effect of causal forest
average_treatment_effect(cf, method="AIPW")
```

Taking the margin and cost into account, we also estimate who should be sent email.
```{r}
#Predict the data
predict(cf)

#Create a file for prediction
predict_form <- predict(cf)

#Plot the overall purchase lift for 
hist(predict(cf)$predictions, 
     main="Histogram of Purchase Lift", 
     xlab="Purchase Lift for Email", ylab="Customers")
abline(v=coef(lm(purch~group,data=wine))[2],col=2) 
abline(v=average_treatment_effect(cf, method="AIPW")[1],col=4)

#Calculate the margin and decide whether to send emails
predict_form$margin <- predict_form$predictions * 0.3 - 0.1
predict_form$sent <- predict_form$margin > 0

#Find the average causal effect based on the people who should be sent emails
dt_wine = data.table(wine[predict_form$sent,])
dagg = dt_wine[,.(open = mean(open), click=mean(click), purch = mean(purch),seOpen = sd(open)/sqrt(.N), seClick=sd(click)/sqrt(.N), sePurch = sd(purch)/sqrt(.N),.N),by = .(sent)]
dagg

```

And we assign the score for the training data and show the characteristics of the target group and non-target group.
```{r}
#Assign score based on the margin and cost
wine[,c('prediction','debiased.error', 'excess.error', 'score','sent')]<- predict_form[,1:5]
wine$Target <- ifelse(wine$sent==TRUE, "Target", "Non-Target")


#Give a general view of the target and non-target group
data.table(wine)[,.(chard = mean(chard), sav_blanc=mean(sav_blanc), syrah = mean(syrah),cab = mean(cab),last_purch = mean(last_purch),visits = mean(visits),.N),by = .(Target)]


```

```{r}
#Calculate the proortion of target consumers based on the whole training data
nrow(wine[predict_form$sent,])/nrow(wine)*100
