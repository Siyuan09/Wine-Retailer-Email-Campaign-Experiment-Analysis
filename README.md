# Wine-Retailer-Email-Campaign-Experiment-Analysis

A wine retailer is running email marketing experiments to evaluate offers prior to sending the offers to a broader set of customers. In this experiment they were examining the impact of an email that was intended to drive purchases. They want to evaluate whether the promotion is effective and who to target with the email campaign. <br>

The data I have is the experiment data containing customer ID, the control or experimental group each customer belongs to as well as the behavior information. Here we need to consider many questions: Is the relationship between sending emails and purchasing amount robust? If the answer is yes to the first question, what type of customers should be the target of our email campaign? And considering the cost, who should we actually send emails to so we can achieve higher profit? To figure out the questions, I divided my analysis into three steps: <br>

1.Verify the impact of email campaign.<br>
2.Explore the target group with high response probability.<br>
3.Determine the target group from the individual level.
